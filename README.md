# Install

**NOTE: fzf-tab needs to be loaded after `compinit`, but before plugins which will wrap widgets, such as [zsh-autosuggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions) or [fast-syntax-highlighting](https://github.com/zdharma/fast-syntax-highlighting)!!**

## Manual

First, clone this repository.

```zsh

```zsh
git clone https://github.com/Aloxaf/fzf-tab $ZSH_CUSTOM/plugins/fzf-tab
```

## Prezto

```

# Usage

Just press <kbd>Tab</kbd> as usual~

You can use <kbd>Ctrl</kdb>+<kdb>Space</kbd> to select multiple results,
and <kbd>/</kbd> to trigger continuous completion (useful when completing a deep path).

Available commands:

- `disable-fzf-tab`: Disable fzf-tab and fallback to compsys.

- `enable-fzf-tab`: Enable fzf-tab.

- `toggle-fzf-tab`: Use it disable/enable plugin. This is also a zle widget.

## Configure

A common configuration is:

```zsh
zstyle ":completion:*:git-checkout:*" sort false
zstyle ':completion:*:descriptions' format '[%d]'
zstyle ':completion:*' list-colors ${(s.:.)LS_COLORS}
zstyle ':fzf-tab:complete:cd:*' fzf-preview 'exa -1 --color=always $realpath'
```

For more information, please see [Wiki#Configuration](https://github.com/Aloxaf/fzf-tab/wiki/Configuration).

## Binary module

By default, fzf-tab uses [zsh-ls-colors](https://github.com/xPMo/zsh-ls-colors) to parse and apply ZLS_COLORS if you have set the `list-colors` tag.

However, it is a pure zsh script and is slow if you have too many files to colorize.
fzf-tab is shipped with a binary module to speed up this process. You can build it with `build-fzf-tab-module`, then it will be enabled automatically.

# Difference from other plugins

fzf-tab doesn't do "complete", it just shows you the results of the default completion system.

So it works EVERYWHERE (variables, function names, directory stack, in-word completion, etc.).
And most of your configuration for default completion system is still valid.

# Compatibility with other plugins

Some plugins may also bind "^I" to their custom widget, like [fzf/shell/completion.zsh](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/blob/master/shell/completion.zsh) or [ohmyzsh/lib/completion.zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/blob/master/lib/completion.zsh#L61-L73).

By default, fzf-tab will call the widget previously bound to "^I" to get the completion list. So there is no problem in most cases, unless fzf-tab is initialized before a plugin which doesn't handle the previous binding properly.

So if you find your fzf-tab doesn't work properly, **please make sure it is the last plugin to bind "^I"** (If you don't know what I mean, just put it to the end of your plugin list).
